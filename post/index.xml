      <description>Google Cloud provides a very useful ML platform to train machine learning models at large-scale. Being an AWS user for most part, I was intriguied by the overall ecosystem Google provides for machine learning and decided to use the ML platform for one of my course project. The goal was to benchmark different neural network architectures. Here&amp;rsquo;s a small part from our final project report that looked into training Faster-RCNN using multiple GPU&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>I spent another exciting summer working on yet another open source project. This time it was during my internship at NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Science and Research). I worked on the Weather Forecasting Model, originally developed at NCAR and being used by over 30,000+ users all over the world. I did a lot of bash scripting (pertty basic though) and python programming as well to help me automate running jobs on Cheyenne Supercomputer and gather a lot of performance results.</description>

      <description>I ocassionally find myself taking some time out and diving into some of the content from this very interesting collection of fairly in-depth and well-written articles, Software is eating the world , exploring, in some sense, the interplay between modern technology and human life post tech hysteria of the early 2000&amp;rsquo;s. Here&amp;rsquo;s my favorite from the intro :  People change, then forget that they changed, and act as though they always behaved a certain way and could never change again.</description>

      <title>High Performance Computing and Machine Learning</title>

      <description>Equations are for eternity. 
Equations are elegant. Their concise nature that captures the underlying complexity of a system to a degree that satisfies &amp;lsquo;observed realities&amp;rsquo; are what scientists and mathematicians consider beautiful. A lot of discovery process for such equations, over the past, took approaches that combined mathematical modeling and computational sciences. Advances in High Performance Computing (HPC) greatly affected this process. In the HPC world, you start with a hypothesis, form a theory over the hypothesis, and additionally run experiments and simulations to build mathematical models that eventually might lead to discovery or newer ideas to explore.</description>

      <title>Websockets with Apache Kafka and Spring</title>
      <link>https://dixitpatel.github.io/2018/04/21/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve spent considerable amount of time earlier, trying to fit together a basic solution using Spring Websockets and Kafka. Understanding each of these technologies individually is probably very straight-forward but using them in the Spring world might take you some time to figure out. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping some tips here would save you time and get started quickly for whatever application you are building. Firstly, here are some good resources (and probably only) to go through to understand basics of using Apache Kafka.</description>

      <description>I spent a very exciting summer working on an open-source project through the Google Summer of Code program. Kudo&amp;rsquo;s to Google for hosting such an amazing program. The project was challenging both technically as well as personally. I had the opportunity to learn a lot about Bioinformatics, from an amazing team of experts at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  (MSKCC). MSKCC is a leading cancer treatment center in United States (and the first to get an NCI designation!</description>
