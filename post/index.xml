      <description>I like exploring new programming languages. It amazes me to think about the variety and complexity of today&amp;rsquo;s software requirements and the abundance of available opportunity to innovate across academic disciplines. As part of this exploration, I decided to learn about Go programming language. I implemented a Distributed Fault-tolerant stack.  Most modern large-scale applications are distributed in nature and are designed around high-availability. A fundamental principle underlying such systems is that failure is inevitable.</description>

      <description>If we humans have at-least the perception of the difference between matter and spacetime and even though we are far from being able to explain the workings of it (Gravitons, Super String Theory), wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it also be worth putting efforts in understanding what allows us those perception in the first place ? And then go on to interpolate those to move to higher dimensions ? 
Maybe we could develop an initial mathematical model based on the interactions between matter and spacetime as observed by us and use combination of HPC and Machine Learning to do simulations and inferences for alternatives and uncover other hidden knowledge ?</description>

      <description>Equations are for eternity. 
Equations are elegant. Their concise nature that captures the underlying complexity of a system to a degree that satisfies &amp;lsquo;observed realities&amp;rsquo; are what scientists and mathematicians consider beautiful. A lot of discovery process for such equations, over the past, took approaches that combined mathematical modeling and computational sciences. Advances in High Performance Computing (HPC) greatly affected this process. In the HPC world, you start with a hypothesis, form a theory over the hypothesis, and additionally run experiments and simulations to build mathematical models that eventually might lead to discovery or newer ideas to explore.</description>
