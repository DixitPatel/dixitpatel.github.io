      <description>Google Cloud provides a very useful ML platform to train machine learning models at large-scale. Being an AWS user for most part, I was intriguied by the overall ecosystem Google provides for machine learning and decided to use the ML platform for one of my course project. The goal was to benchmark different neural network architectures. Here&amp;rsquo;s a small part from our final project report that looked into training Faster-RCNN using multiple GPU&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>Equations are for eternity. 
Equations are elegant. Their concise nature that captures the underlying complexity of a system to a degree that satisfies &amp;lsquo;observed realities&amp;rsquo; are what scientists and mathematicians consider beautiful. A lot of discovery process for such equations, over the past, took approaches that combined mathematical modeling and computational sciences. Advances in High Performance Computing (HPC) greatly affected this process. In the HPC world, you start with a hypothesis, form a theory over the hypothesis, and additionally run experiments and simulations to build mathematical models that eventually might lead to discovery or newer ideas to explore.</description>
