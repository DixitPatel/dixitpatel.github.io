      <description>I spent another exciting summer working on yet another open source project. This time it was during my internship at NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Science and Research). I worked on the Weather Forecasting Model, originally developed at NCAR and being used by over 30,000+ users all over the world. I did a lot of bash scripting (pertty basic though) and python programming as well to help me automate running jobs on Cheyenne Supercomputer and gather a lot of performance results.</description>

      <description>Equations are for eternity. 
Equations are elegant. Their concise nature that captures the underlying complexity of a system to a degree that satisfies &amp;lsquo;observed realities&amp;rsquo; are what scientists and mathematicians consider beautiful. A lot of discovery process for such equations, over the past, took approaches that combined mathematical modeling and computational sciences. Advances in High Performance Computing (HPC) greatly affected this process. In the HPC world, you start with a hypothesis, form a theory over the hypothesis, and additionally run experiments and simulations to build mathematical models that eventually might lead to discovery or newer ideas to explore.</description>
